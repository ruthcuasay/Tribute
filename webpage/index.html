		<h2> APPRECIATION MESSAGE </h2>
		
		<p> We pay tribute to our teachers  who made civilization, who gave us knowledge of things we don’t know before, who transformed us to become more knowledgeable persons that we are now, who shaped and molded us to become better  models of the future. They play many roles in a student’s life - the role of a mentor, friend, advisor or councilor, and parent.</p>
